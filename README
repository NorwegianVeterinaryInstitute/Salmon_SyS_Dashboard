## Salmon_SyS_Dashboard ###

This code was developed as a prototype to explore concepts for a potential mortality monitoring dashboard in salmon farming.
Active development was paused.

The script 'data_salmonSyS.r' is not included due to data confidentiality.
It was responsible for preparing key datasets used in the dashboard (e.g., df_noExc, consec_innac_map).
